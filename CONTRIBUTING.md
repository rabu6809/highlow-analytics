# contribution

there aren't really contributing rules but:
 - open issues for new modes

use an IDE, preferably JetBrains Pycharm. VS Code is a second option.

## versioning: release/major/minor
 - release updates are big and must add multiple new features (overhauls, rewrites, big updates)
 - major updates add 1-2 new features
 - minor is mainly bugfixes and patches
